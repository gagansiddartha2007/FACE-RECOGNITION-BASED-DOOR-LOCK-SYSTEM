Known Faces Training Directory
Instructions
This folder contains subdirectories for each authorized person. The main script train_faces.py will automatically scan all subfolders here and create face encodings.

How to add authorized users:
   1. Create a folder for each person.
   2. Add photos of each person:
        Put 3-10 clear, front-facing photos of the person in their folder
        Good lighting, no glasses/sunglasses, minimal background
        JPG or PNG format works best
